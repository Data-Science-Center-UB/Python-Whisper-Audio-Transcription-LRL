# Whisper Audio to Text Transcription and Speaker Diarization for Low-Resource Language (LRL) - Python Workflows

This repository provides hands-on, self-learning notebooks for building a Python workflow for speech-to-text and speaker-aware transcripts. It shows how to use OpenAI Whisper with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), including [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speaker diarization.

You can use the materials in the GitHub repository to deliver a Whisper-based audio transcription workshop. Related workshop materials are published as an open educational resource [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18693970).

The repository consists of:

/Notebooks (Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing audio files and conducting transcription including speaker diarization and application with LRL) <br>
/Images (images loaded in the Jupyter notebooks) <br>
/Data_Raw (datasets downloaded and loaded in the Jupyter notebooks) <br>
/Data_Preprocessed (a single intermediate audio file created in the faster-whisper-pyannote.py notebook that holds the input audio converted to a consistent format) <br>
/Results (exemplary transcribed text) <br>
/requirements.txt (Python packages needed to run the notebooks; install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`) <br>

>About the project
>
>This repository was developed and delivered as part of workshops within the framework of the DataNord project at the Data Science Center of the University of Bremen. The DataNord project is funded under the grant number 16DKZ2026A by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) and financed by the European Union – NextGenerationEU. It is part of a broader initiative to strengthen data literacy among researchers by offering practical, hands-on training in core areas of 1) data science, 2) research data management (RDM), 3) critical thinking, and 4) ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA). The materials were developed by Annika Nolte (ORCID: 0000-0001-9562-0728) and Nele Fuchs (ORCID: 0009-0004-6837-6968).
